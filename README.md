# bare-bones
Simple blank theme I created while taking a WordPress course on Treehouse a few years ago.  I use this to start all my WordPress projects.

Things to note:
- On most pages, I put the file name within a p tag to easily identify it.  Don’t forget to remove the p tags as you’re developing!
- The footer has three text widgets, so delete if you don’t need. I usually float them all left and give them each a 33% width.
- Check out the functions.php file to load up your fonts and any other resouces.
